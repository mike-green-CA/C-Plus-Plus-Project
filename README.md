# C-Plus-Plus-Project

This was a project I made in COMP 2618 in C++

The IDE was VisualStudio

This project is a game of hangman. There is a collection of words that are chosen randomly by the program; then you guess which word it is; you can not guess the same letter twice, and for each incorrect guess you'll get a body part.

Head torso, arms, legs and you lose.

when you're done a game.

enter y - to consintue.
enter n - to close and exit the program.
